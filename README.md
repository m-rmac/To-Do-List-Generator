# To-Do List Generator with Create React App

A quick project to play around with the new concepts I have been learning with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Lessons Learned

My first React project, 


## Depolyment

Deployed with [github pages](https://m-rmac.github.io/To-Do-List-Generator/)

## Get started
From your command line, first clone this repo:

```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/m-rmac/To-Do-List-Generator.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd To-Do-List-Generator

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin

```

Then you can install the dependencies using NPM:

Using NPM:
```
## Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
You should now have a development server running in your default browser [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
```

`yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
